        is something that runs deep within everyone , even though
        most people don't take the time to find someone who 
        truly respects them . It seems like people are just 
        looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of
        attention , settling for something much less than respect .
        I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship
        grow is by showing respect .

        I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be 
        respected . What is respect ? Respect is showing someone
        extra special attention , or high regard , based on a desire
        to show them how highly they are valued .
